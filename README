Photography Assistant provides exposure setting calculation and depth of field/hyperfocal distance calculation.
It was designed mostly to use with film cameras, although the dof/hyperfocal function can be useful for digital cameras too.
It also tries to take advantage of the ambient light sensor on the phone.
The exposure setting calculation supports three modes: aperture priority, shutter priority and manual mode.
